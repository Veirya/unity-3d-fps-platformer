# Unity 3D FPS Platformer

WIP game intended to be a 3D FPS Platformer along the same style as the Portal series. Current
features include ability to walk up slopes, jump, variable player influence on speed depending
on if in the air, and a mostly-functional rope grapple hook. Visuals are completely grayboxed
at the moment.
